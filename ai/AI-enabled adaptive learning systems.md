# Background
A number of other types of literature analysis (bibliometric analysis, for instance) had a notable lack of evidence concerning the potential association between certain problems faced by students and lectures and AI-enabled learning interventions that solve these problems.
# Methodology
This paper used systematic mapping, a survey method that is used to give an overview of a research area through classification and counting contributions in relation to the categories of that classification.

In the mapping, by applying network analysis to to a matrix of co-occurrences using the CorText (https://www.cortext.net/), the co-occurrences of authors associated with major research themes in AI-enabled learning studies are visualized and clustered. The clustering indicates most of the AI-enabled learning interventions are systems and frameworks and use algorithms.

Meanwhile, the authors identified the main problems (learning process, the difference in the profiles and backgrounds of students, and engagement and motivation encountered during the learning process) and how user addressed those problems using AI-enabled learning interventions. 

Finally, the authors overviewed the analytics method and techniques that are utilized in AI-enabled learning systems. They classified those techniques into three categories: 
- prescriptive, which has been used for detecting and classifying questions that are applied to establish students' knowledge levels as well as selecting the required items for students.
	- Suggested use this method to address the complexity of learning systems models and students' failure to attain target skills.
- descriptive, which identifies deviations in the behaviors of students or lecturers, analyze students' learning problems and evaluate their mastery and the knowledge they currently possess based on their success and failures.
	- Suggested use this method to enhance students' learning performance, address issues such as the lack of evaluation standards and methods for AI-enabled learning systems as well as difficulties in finding an efficient way to organize complex information.
- prescriptive, which select the more suitable solution problems, maximize learning path choice and thus establish optimal data.
	- Suggested use this method to solve limitations in adaptive learning systems, the failure to address process-oriented adaptation and difficulties in finding an efficient way to organize complex information.

# Implications
The implication of this literature is divided into two parts: theory and practice.

For theoretical research, authors identified the prominent themes in the field of AI-enabled learning system (RQ1), problems faced by students and lecturers in their respective learning environments as well as data analytics methods and how they are utilized in AI-enabled learning system.

For practice, the study shows most AI-enabled learning interventions are systems and frameworks, how to address the issue of outdated and complex models in learning models should be improved by AI techniques building on learning analytics.
- Guidance for Implementing AI-Enabled Learning Systems in Educational Institutions:
	- what are the useful frameworks, system, and algorithms
- challenges that current AI-enabled learning environment are facing.
	- The discrepancy between what an AI-enabled learning intervention can do and how it is actually utilized in practice. User do not understand how to extensively use such system.
	- many system are outdated and poorly tested in practice.

 > When conducting the mapping 
> - defining research questions (RQs):
> -  conducting a search for relevant papers key words, screening of papers, 
	- focused on paper published in 2015-2020 (147 papers in total)
	- categorized based on 
		- reference type
		- type of paper
		- common techniques utilized to design interventions
		- research motivations 
		- type of intervention utilized
		- problems and concerns
# Result
## RQ1: What are the main research motivations and objectives of studies on AI-enabled learning environments?
Table 2, Fig. 7
- \[1\] partnerships between educational institutions in terms of using adaptive learning systems
- \[22\] redesigning courses to adopt adaptive learning systems or adaptive learning modules
- \[36\] utilized algorithms, mechanisms and AI/ML techniques
- \[41\] presented general or comprehensive literature reviews
- \[29\] proposing evaluation methods or evaluating AI enabled learning systems and adaptive courses
- \[27\] proposing and developing frameworks for adaptive learning and adaptive learning systems
- \[27\] model
The closer the cluster is, the higher association of the objective, some of the cluster are overlapped, meaning both are involved.

## RQ2: What are the core research problems and concerns in the field of AI-enabled learning systems and interventions/solutions proposed to address them?
### Problem 1: Learning process. 
Comprises of the difficulty sharing learning resources, the high redundancy of learning materials, learning isolation and inappropriate information load. To address such problems:
- use e-leaning model to provide most suitable learning content for each student
- make real-time decisions and offer students training according to their dynamic learning pace.
- combines pedagogical, domain and learner models to provide cognitive feedbacks

### Problem 2: Difference in student's profile and background.
Current educational system do not fit the characteristics of each student.
- prevent knowledge decay
- generate learning path
- recommend collaborative activities

### Problem 3: Engagement and motivation.
How to use adaptive AI to tackle high levels of demotivation, passive attitudes, boredom, poor engagement and frustration among the students.
- adaptive recommender system-based framework for personalized teaching on e-learning platforms.
- affective tutoring system to provide students help when they are bored.

## RQ3: What are the common AI and data analytics techniques utilized to design the interventions?

# Problems on the existing AI-enabled learning environment:
- lack of real-world implementation
- mismatch between potential and practical use
- complexity and qutdated models
