Brief: This notes is made while I am reading the book *Letters on Beauty* (谈美) written by Zhu Guangqian (朱光潜). Since this book is in Chinese, so this notes is also in Chinese. If I have time, or if I want to make a time, I will try to translate some part of the notes as I truely admire Zhu's books.
